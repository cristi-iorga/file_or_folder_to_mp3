# file_or_folder_to_mp3

Operating System: Windows
Requirements: ffmpeg
Input Mode: drag'n'drop
Input format: *media file* (as far as ffmpeg supports it)
Output format: .mp3 @ 260VBR
Output folder: same as input
General concept: quick and dirty

This is a little Windows Batch script that converts a media file or batch-processes a folder with media files and outputs an mp3 file - bitrate is VBR at 260kbs. Simply drag and drop a file and it will spit out an mp3 in the input folder.



Typical usage scenarios include:

You've just mixed some badass tracks and exported them as .WAV files, but you want to send them to your client as .MP3 files for the sake of time. 

You've mixed a whole concert and split it up into individual pieces and you don't want to manually convert each of them into .MP3 in order to send them.

You have a bunch of video files, but you only need the audio from them. 


Enjoy!
