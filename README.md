# file_or_folder_to_mp3

### Overview:

Operating System: Windows

Requirements: ffmpeg

Input Mode: drag'n'drop

Input format: *media file* (as far as ffmpeg supports it)

Output format: .mp3 @ 260VBR

Output folder: same as input

General concept: quick and dirty

### Short Description


This is a little Windows Batch script that converts a media file or batch-processes a folder with media files and outputs an mp3 file - bitrate is VBR at 260kbs. Simply drag and drop a file and it will spit out an mp3 in the input folder.


### Typical Usage Scenarios:

Example 1: You've just mixed some badass tracks and exported them as .WAV files, but you want to send them to your client as .MP3 files for the sake of time. 

Example 2 :You've mixed a whole concert and split it up into individual pieces and you don't want to manually convert each of them into .MP3 in order to send them.

Example 3: You have a bunch of video files and you only need an audio. There's no way you're importing each one of them into a DAW or video editor. No way. That's gonna take for ever... 

#### Enjoy!
